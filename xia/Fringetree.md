**Description:** White fringetree is a tree native to the savannas and lowlands of the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to as much as 10 to 11m tall, though ordinarily less. The leaves are opposite, simple, ovate or oblong, 7.5 to 20cm long and 2.5 to 10cm broad. The richly-scented flowers have a pure white, deeply four-lobed corolla, the lobes thread-like, 1.5 to 2.5cm long and 3mm broad. It is usually dioecious, though occasional plants bear flowers of both sexes. The fruit is an ovoid dark blue to purple drupe 1.5 to 2cm long, containing a single seed (rarely two or three), mature in late summer to mid fall.
