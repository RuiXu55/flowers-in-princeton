**Description:** The tulip (Chinese:  水仙) is a Eurasian and North African genus of herbaceous, perennial, bulbous plants in the lily family, with showy flowers. Tulips are spring-blooming perennials that grow from bulbs. Depending on the species, tulip plants can be between 4 inches an 28 inches high. The tulip's large flowers usually bloom on scape with leaves in a rosette at gound level and a single flowering stalk arising from amongst the leaves. Tulip stems have few strap-shaped leaves, with waxy coating. The generally cup or star-shaped tulip flower has three petals and three sepals, which are often termed tepals because they are nearly identical. These six tepals are often marked on the interior surface near the bases with darker colorings. Tulip flowers come in a wide variety of colors, except pure blue
