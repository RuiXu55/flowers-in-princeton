**Description:** Alsike clover (Chinese: 豆科，车轴草[三叶草]) is a perennial plant species in the family *Fabaceae*, and native to mainland Europe. The leaves are alternate and stalked with small stipules, and have three blunt-tipped ovate, unspotted leaflets with finely toothed margins. The stalked, pale pink or whitish flower head grows from the leaf axils, and trifoliate leaves are unmarked. The individual florets have a five-lobed calyx and an irregular corolla consisting of five pink petals, just like most other species in the family *Fabaceae*.
