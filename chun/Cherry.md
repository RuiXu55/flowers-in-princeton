**Description:** A cherry blossom (Chinese: 蔷薇科,李属,樱花) is the flower of several trees of genus *Prunus*, particularly the Japanese cherry, which is called *sakura* after the Japanese. Currently widely distributed in temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, including Japan, China, Europe, Canada and the United State. Many varieties that have been cultivated for ornamental use do not produce fruit. The flowers are usually white to pink, with five petals and five sepals. Flowers are borne singly, or in umbels of two to six or sometimes more on racemes. The fruit is a fleshy drupe (a "prune") with a single relatively large, hard-coated seed (a "stone").
