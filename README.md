**People come and go, but plants survive and thrive.**

This draft is a collection of plants/flowers in Princeton University. The flowers are sorted based on their flowering season and are divided into four sections: spring, summer, fall and winter. For each individual entry, at least one picture is listed to help identify the plant (all the pictures are taken by the author between 2016-2017), The picture is followed by a short description (e.g. name, origin, distinguished features, funny facts et.al.). Common names are used if possible. Sometimes the name listed is a genus name rather than individual species's name (doesn't matter if you don't do research on this). Locations in campus where these flowers are discovered and some dditional pictures (if available) are also provided.

This work is inspired by the book "grass and trees in Yanyuan", a collection of plants in Peking University.
