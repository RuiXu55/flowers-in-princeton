**Description:** Moonlight hydrangea (Chinese: 绣球属）is in genus *Hydrangea* and native to Southern and eastern Asia. They are shrubs 1 to 3m tall, and woody root climber has long-stalked, ovate silver-green leaves with deep-green veining. In midsummer, shimmering drops of creamy, moonlight flowers shower the foliage. Blooms are really broad, flattened heads of numerous fertile florets surrounded by large, sterile outer flowers that have just one spade-shaped petal each. Fragrance is like a mixture of apples and lilies.
