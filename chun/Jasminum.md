**Description:** Winter jasminum (Chinese: 木犀科素馨属, 迎春花) is a slender, deciduous, shrub native to China. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental, and is reportedly naturalized in France and in scattered locations in the United States (including here in New Jersey). Winter jasminum can grow to 3 meters with arching green shoots and dark green leaves. Each leaf is divided into three oval-oblong leaflets. It flowers from Nov. to Mar. every year. (That's why the Chinese name of the flower means welcome the Spring.) The solitary flowers often appear on the bare stems with six petals and are bright yellow or white.

**Locations in Campus:** Various places in campus, including South corner of McCosh Health Center and north of Peyton Hall.
