**Description:** Galic mustard, or Jack-by-the-hedge (Chinese:十字花科，葱芥) is a biennial flowering plant in the Mustard family, and native to Europe, western and central Asia, and east to northern Pakistan and western China. In the first year of growth, plants form clumps of round shaped, slightly wrinkled leaves, that when crushed smell like garlic. The next year plants flowr in spring, producing cross shaped white flowers in dense clusters. As the flowering stems bloom they elongate into a spike-like  shape. When blooming is complete, plants produce upright fruits that release seeds in mid-summer.
