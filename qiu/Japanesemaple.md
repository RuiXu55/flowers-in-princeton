**Description:** Japanese maple (Chinese:槭树科，鸡爪槭／日本槭树) is a species of woody plant native to Japan, China, Korea, eastern Mongolia, and southeast Russia. Japanese maple is a deciduous shrub or tree reaching heights of 6-10m.  In habit, it is often shaped like a hemisphere (especially when younger) or takes on a dome-like form, especially when mature. The leaves are 4–12 cm long and wide, palmately lobed with five, seven, or nine acutely pointed lobes. The flowers are produced in small cymes, the individual flowers with five red or purple sepals and five whitish petals. The fruit is a pair of winged samaras, each samara 2–3 cm long with a 6–8 mm seed.
