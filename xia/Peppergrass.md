**Description:** Peppergrass (Chinese: 北美独行菜) is an annual or biennial plant native to much of North America. It can be found elsewhere as introduced species.  On the racemes are first small white flowers, and later greenish fruits.  The most identifiable character of peppergrass is its raceme, which looks like a bottlebrush. The entire plant is generally between 10 and 50 centimeters tall. The leaves are sessile, linear to lanceolate and get larger as they approach the base. Note that all parts of the plant have a peppery taste
*The plant is edible.*
