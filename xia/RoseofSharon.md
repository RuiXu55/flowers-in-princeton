**Description:** Rose of Sharon (Chinese: 木槿) is is a hardy deciduous shrub. It is upright and vase-shaped, reaching 2–4 m (7–13 ft) in height, bearing large trumpet-shaped flowers with prominent yellow-tipped white stamens.[5] The flowers are often pink in color, but can also be dark pink (almost purple), light pink or white. Individual flowers are short-lived, lasting only a day. However, numerous buds are produced on the shrub's new growth, and this provides prolific flowering over a long summer blooming period. The soil in which the Hibiscus thrives on is a moist, but well-drained, mixture of sand, clay, chalk, and loam. Maintaining an Alkaline, Neutral pH(5.5 - 7.0) levels. Individual flowers that grow only last a day, contrasting when numerous flowers are produced providing a prolific life span lasting a long summer blooming period. They're highly tolerant to air pollution, heat, humidity, poor soil and drought.[6] Shoots make interesting indoor vase cuttings, as they stay green for a long time, and some new flowers may open from the more mature buds. The species has naturalized very well in many suburban areas, and might even be termed slightly invasive, so frequently does it seed around.
