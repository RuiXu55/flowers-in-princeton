**Description:** Chelone glabra (white turtlehead) is an herbaceous species of plant native to North America. Its native range extends from Georgia to Newfoundland and Labrador and from Mississippi to Manitoba.[1] Its natural habitat is wet areas, such as riparian forests and swamps. This species has opposite, simple leaves, on stout, upright stems. The flowers are white, borne in late summer and early fall.
It is the primary plant on which the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly will lay its eggs (although the butterfly to some extent will use a few other species).
