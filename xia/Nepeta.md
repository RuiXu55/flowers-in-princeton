**Description:** Nepeta (Chinese:荆芥） is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiaceae also known as catmints. The genus is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, and has also naturalized in North America. Most of the species are herbaceous perennial plants, but some are annuals. They have sturdy stems with opposite heart-shaped, green to gray-green leaves.[3] Nepeta plants are usually aromatic in foliage and flowers.
The tubular flowers can be lavender, blue, white, pink, or lilac, and spotted with tiny lavender-purple dots. The flowers are located in verticillasters grouped on spikes; or the verticillasters are arranged in opposite cymes, racemes, or panicles – toward the tip of the stems.
