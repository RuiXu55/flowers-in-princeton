![](http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~ruixu/fig/Goldfink.jpg)

**Description:** Coreopsis is a genus of between 75-80 species from North America, Mexico, Central and South America.

The genus name comes from the Greek words koris meaning bug and opsis meaning like in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.

'Goldfink' features solitary, yellow, daisy-like flowers (2-3" diameter) with yellow rays (lobed at the tips) and flat darker yellow center disks atop slender, erect stems rising to only 9" tall. Flowers typically bloom from late spring to late summer and sometimes well into fall, though bloom period can be much shorter if spent flowers are not regularly deadheaded. Narrow, lance-shaped leaves are mostly located in a tuft near the base of the plant. Lower basal leaves are mostly entire, while smaller stem leaves may be pinnately lobed. Plants in the genus Coreopsis are sometimes commonly called tickseed in reference to the resemblance of the seeds to ticks.
