**Description:** Wild geranium is a perennial plant native to woodland in eastern North America. Wild geranium grows up to 60cm tall, producing upright usually unbranched stems and flowers in spring to early summer. The leaves are palmately lobed with five or seven deeply cut lobes. The flowers are rose purple, pale or violet-purple (rarely white), with five petals and ten stamens. They are grouped in loose corymbs or umbels of two to five at the top of the flower stems. The fruit capsule, which springs open when ripe, consists of five cells each containing one seed joined to a long beak-like column 2-3cm long produced from the center of the old flower.
