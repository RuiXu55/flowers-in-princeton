**Description:**  Wisteria (Chinese: 紫藤萝) is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family native to Eastern United States and China/Korea/Japan. Wisterias climb by twining their stems either clockwise or counterclockwise round any available support. The leaves are alternate, 15-35cm long, pinnate, with 9-19 leaflets. The flowers are produced in pendulous racemes. The seeds are produced in pods and are poisonous. All parts of the plant contain a saponin called Wisterin which is toxic and may cause dizziness.
