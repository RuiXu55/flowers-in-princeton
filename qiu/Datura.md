**Description:** Datura (Chinese: 曼陀罗)  is a genus of nine species of poisonous vespertine flowering plants belonging to the family Solanaceae, also known as devil's trumpets. Datura species are herbaceous, leafy annuals and short-lived perennials which can reach up to 2 m in height. The leaves are alternate, 10–20 cm long and 5–18 cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The flowers are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of Brugmansia), trumpet-shaped, 5–20 cm long and 4–12 cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The fruit is a spiny capsule 4–10 cm long and 2–6 cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous seeds. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.

**All species of Datura are poisonous, especially their seeds and flowers.**

**Locations in Campus:** South of 185 Broadmead.
