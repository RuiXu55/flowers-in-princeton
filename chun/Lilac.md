**Description:** Common lilac (Chinese: 木犀科，紫丁香) is a species of flowering plant in the olive family, native to Balkan Peninsula, where it grows on rocky hills. Lilac is a large deciduous shrub or multi-stemmed small tree, growing to 6-7m high.
The leaves are simple, light green to glaucous, with pinnate leaf venation, and an entire margin. They are arranged in opposite paris or occasionally in whorls of three. The flowers have a tubular base to the corolla 6-10mm long with an open four-lobed apex. The fruit is a dry, smooth, brown capsule, splitting in two to release the two-winged seeds.
