**Description:** Bluebell (Chinese: 蓝钟属，蓝铃草) is a bulbous perennial plant, found in Atlantic areas from north-western Spain to the British Isles, and also frequently used as a garden plant. Bluebell flowers in spring and produce a nodding, non-sided inflorescence of 5-12 tubular, sweet-scented violet-blue flowers, with strongly recurved tepals, and 3-6 long, linear, basal leaves.
