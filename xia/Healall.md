**Description:** Heal-all (also known as common self-heal, heart-of-the-earth) is an herbaceous plant in the genus *Prunella*, and found throughout Europe, Asia and North America, as well as most temperate climates. self-heal grows 5 to 30 cm high, with creeping, self-rooting, tough, square, reddish stems branching at leaf axis. The leaves are lance shaped, serrated and reddish at the tip, about 2.5 cm long and 1.5 cm broad, and growing in opposite pairs down the square stem. The flowers grow from a clublike, somewhat square, whirled cluster; immediately below this club is a pair of stalkless leaves standing out on either side like a collar. Flowers are two lipped and tubular. The top lip is a purple hood, and the bottom lip is often white; it has three lobes, with the middle lobe being larger and fringed upwardly.
