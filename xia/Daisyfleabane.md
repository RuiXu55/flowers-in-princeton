**Description:** Daisy fleabane (Chinese: 菊科,一年蓬) is a North American plant species in the daisy family. Daisy fleabane is a herbaceous plant with alternate, simple leaves, and green, sparsely hairy stems, which can grow between 30 and 150 centimeters in height. Leaves are numerous and large relative to other species of Erigeron, with lower leaves, especially basal leaves, coarsely toothed or cleft, a characteristic readily distinguishing this species from most other Erigeron. Upper leaves are sometimes, not always toothed, but may have a few coarse teeth towards the outer tips. The flower heads are white with yellow centers, with the white to pale lavender rays, borne spring through fall depending on the individual plant.
