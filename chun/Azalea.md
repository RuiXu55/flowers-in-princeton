**Description:** Azaleas (Chinese: 杜鹃花科，杜鹃花/映山红) are shade tolerant flowering shrubs in the genus Rhododendron. They are native to several continents including Asia, Europe and North America. Azaleas bloom in spring and their flowers often last for several weeks. They are planted abundantly as ornamentals in the southwestern US, southern Asia and part of southwest Europe. The funnel-shaped flowers are usually white, pink or red. In Chinese culture, the azalea is known as "thinking of home bush" and immortalized in the poetry of Du Fu.
