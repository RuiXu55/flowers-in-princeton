**Description:** Mock strawberry (Chinese: 蔷薇科，蛇莓) is native to eastern and southern Asia, but has been introduced to many places as an ornamental plant. The leaves are trifoliate, roughtly veined beneath, dark green, and often persisting through the winter, arising from short crown. The yellow flowers are produced in mid spring and sporadically throughout the growing season. The aggregate accessory fruit is similar to true strawberry and usually red or white. They are eatable, but they have very little flavor.

**Locations in Campus:** In front of Peyton Hall.
