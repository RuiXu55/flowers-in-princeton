**Description:**  Malus is a genus of about 30–55 species of small deciduous apple trees or shrubs in the family *Rosaceae*, including domesticated orchard apple. Other speices are generally known as crabapple or wild apples. Apple trees are usually 4-12m tall, with dense twiggy crown. The leaves are 3–10 cm long, alternate, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are borne in corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, and are perfect, with usually red stamens that produce copious pollen, and a half-inferior ovary.
