**Description:** Tigerlily (Chinese: 卷丹) is  an Asian species of lily, native to China, Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East. The flowers are borne on an erect stem 80–200 cm tall, clothed with the more or less linear leaves 6–10 cm long and 1–2 cm broad. It is one of a very small number of species that produce aerial bulblets, known as bulbils, in the leaf axils along the stem. These can be used to propagate the plant. Flowers on the plant last for a short period of time before they wither and are replaced by newer flowers. Tigerlily flowers throughout the summer between June and August.
