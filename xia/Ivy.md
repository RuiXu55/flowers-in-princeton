**Description:** Ivy is a species of flowering plant in the family *Araliaceae*, native to most of Europe and western Asia. It is rampant, clinging evergreen vine, growing to 20-30m high. The leaves are alternate, with palmately five-lobed juvenile leaves on creeping and climbing stems, and unlobed cordate adult leaves on fertile flowering stems exposed to full sun, usually high in the crowns of trees or the top of rock faces. The flowers are produced from late summer until late autumn, individually small, in umbels, greenish-yellow, and very rich in nectar, an important late autumn food source for bees and other insects.

**Locations in Campus:** Many, many places in campus.
