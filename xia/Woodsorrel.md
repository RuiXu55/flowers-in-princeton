Wood sorrel typically grows a maximum of 15 inches tall. Its small heart-shaped, "folded" leaves grow in groups of 3. Its tiny flowers are typically white or yellow though they can be pink or violet depending on species. *Oxalis* means literally "sour" and is named as such due to its oxalic acid content. Many domesticated vegetables, including spinach and broccoli, also contain oxalic acid, which is considered toxic when consumed in large quantities because it inhibits absorption of calcium.
