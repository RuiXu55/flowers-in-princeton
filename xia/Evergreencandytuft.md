**Description:** Evergreen candytuft is a species of flowering plant in the family *Brassicaceae*, native to southern Europe. It is a spreading subshrub growing to 30 cm high by 40 cm  broad. As an ornamental plant it is a spring-blooming favourite, often seen cascading over rocks and walls, or used as groundcover. The glossy, evergreen foliage forms a billowing mound, with many fragrant, pure white flowers for several weeks during spring and early summer. When grown in a garden it may require light pruning right after blooming, but otherwise plants can be left alone in fall and early spring.
