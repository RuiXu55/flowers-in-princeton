**Description:** White (Heath) Aster is is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to much of North America, as well as northern Mexico. It has also been introduced to many areas beyond its native
range. White aster is an herbaceous perennial with stems from 1 to 3 ft (0.3 to 0.9 m) tall. Its leaves are sessile (stalkless) and
narrow, and become smaller towards the end of the stems and branches. It has white or rarely pinkish, daisy-like composite flower heads with
yellow centers that appear in late summer through fall (autumn). They are rather small, 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 inch (8 to 10 mm) across.
