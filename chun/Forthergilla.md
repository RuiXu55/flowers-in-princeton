**Description:** Fothergilla (witch alder) is a genus of two or three species of flowering plants in the family *Hamamelidaceae*, native to woodland and swamps of the southeastern United States. They are low-growing deciduous shrubs growing to 1–3 m tall with downy twigs. The brush-like flowers are produced before the leaves in spring on terminal spikes; they do not have any petals, but a conspicuous cluster of white stamens 2–3 cm long. The leaves are alternate, broad ovoid, 4–10 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin; they are noted for their brilliant orange or red fall colors.[1]
