**Description:** Eastern redbud is a large deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America.  It typically grows to 6-9m tall with short, often twisted trunk and spreading branches. The leaves are alternate, simple and heart shaped with an entire margin, thin and papery, and maybe slightly hairy below.  The flowers are showy, light to dark red to chestnut in color, appearing in clusters from spring to early summer on bare stems before the leaves. The fruit are flattened, dry, brown, pea-like pods that contain flat, elliptical, brown seeds 6mm long, maturing in August to October.
