**Description:** Begonia (Chinese: 秋海棠） is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family *Begoniaceae*, and occur in subtropical and tropical moist climates, in South and Central America, Africa, and southern Asia. The plants are monoecious, with unisexual male and female flowers occurring separately on the same plant; the male contains numerous stamens, and the female has a large inferior ovary and two to four branched or twisted stigmas. In most species, the fruit is a winged capsule containing numerous minute seeds, although baccate fruits are also known. The leaves, which are often large and variously marked or variegated, are usually asymmetric (unequal-sided).
