**Description:** Hop clover is a species of clover native to Europe and western Asia, growing in dry sandy grassland habitats, fields, woodland margins, roadsides. It is a herbaceous annual plant, growing to 10-30cm tall, with distinctive yellow flowerheads that superficially resemble hop flowers. Each flower head is a cylindrical or spherical collection of 20-40 individual flowers.  The flowers become brown upon aging and drying, enclosing the fruit, a one seeded pod. The leaves are alternate and trifoliate, with three oblong or elliptical leaflets.
