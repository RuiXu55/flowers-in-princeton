**Description:** Angelonia is a genus of about 30 species which occur from Mexico to Argentina and is classified in the Plantaginaceae. They are herbaceous plantas occurring mainly in arid and semi-arid habitats. Most Angelonia species can be found in Northeastern Brazil in the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest namely Caatinga.[1] The flowers of Angelonia are highly specialized in regarding to the pollination, because they have hairs in the inner corolla, which produces oils collected by the oil bee pollinators, specially of the genus Centris. Some species are cultivated as ornamental plants for their snapdragon-like flowers, but need warm temperatures and large amounts of sunlight.[3] Garden varieties are mainly cultivars of A. angustifolia.
Angelonia produces beautiful spikes of mauve, purple, pink, blue, or white flowers all summer long to early autumn.
