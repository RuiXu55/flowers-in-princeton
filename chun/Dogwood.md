**Description:** Flowering dogwood (Chinese: 山茱萸科,四照花) is a species of flowering plant in the family *Cornaceae* native to eastern North America and northern Mexico. The flowers are produced in a dense, rounded umbel-shaped inflorescence, or flower-head. The flower head is surrounded  by four conspicuous large white, pink or red "petals" (actually bracts). The fruit is a cluster of two to ten separate drupes, each 10-15mm long and about 8mm wide, and they are important food source for birds.


The tree is commonly planted as an ornamental in residential and public areas because of its showy bracts and interesting bark structure.
