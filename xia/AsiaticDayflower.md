**Description:** Asiatic dayflower (Chinese: 鸭跖草)  is an herbaceous annual plant in the dayflower family, native throughout much of East Asia and northern parts of Southeast Asia.  In China, the plant is known as yazhicao, roughly translating to "duckfoot herb". The flowers are arranged on inflorescences called cincinni (singular: cincinnus), which are also called scorpioid cymes. This is a form of a monochasium where the lateral branches arise alternately. There are often two cincinni present, though the upper, or distal, cincinnus may be vestigial.
