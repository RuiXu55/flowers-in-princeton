**Description:**  Oxeye daisy (Chinese: 法兰西菊) is a widespread flowering plant native to Europe and the temperate regions of Asia and an introduced plant to North America, Australia and New Zealand.  Oxeye daisy is a perennial herb 0.3m high. The stem is mostly unbranched and sprouts laterally from a creeping rhizomatous rootstock. The leaves are dark green on both sides. The basal and middle leaves are petiolate, obovate to spoon-shaped, and serrate to dentate. The upper leaves are shorter, sessile, and borne along the stem.  Oxeye daisy blooms from late spring to autumn. The small flower head, not larger than 5cm, consists of about 20 white ray florets that surround a yellow disc. The plant produces an abundant number of flat seeds, without pappus, that remain viable in the soil for 2 to 3 years. It also spreads vegetatively by rhizomes.
